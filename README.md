#Void Miners
Current todo list/idea for the game:

- Upgrade void miners that you buy from NPC
- Players spawn on a hot air balloon
- Players can upgrade placed void miners by installing artifacts (+25% efficiency)
- Players can pay to increase artifact slots (1 default)
- Artifacts are found by going on expiditions
- Progress to a better zone/planet for greater income (not sure if money boost or different ores, the ladder would require further ideas related to that)
- Void crystals, which are different from artifact, chnge the color of your beam with particles for visuals, resulting in greater profit
- POSSIBLY: Expand base either by new zones or by paying for squares
- 

#Pivoting to Planet Miners

- Same as void miners, only difference is the planet (zone) that you're on will change the ores that you get from mining.
- Think Earth -> Sun -> Star -> Supernova -> 
- Iron, Cole -> Sun dust, gold, -> God ores, Emerald -> Instable Carbon,
